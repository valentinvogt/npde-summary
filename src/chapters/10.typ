== Heat conduction in a Fluid
<sub:heat-conduction>

Consider a flowing fluid. Then there is the key quantity, the #emph[flow field] $bold(v) : Omega subset bb(R)^d arrow.r bb(R)^d$,
where $d$ is the dimension we consider. The flow field can be understood as
$bold(v) (bx) =$ fluid velocity at point $bx in Omega$.

Given a flow field $bold(v)$, we can consider the autonomous initial value
problem
$ dot(bold(y)) = bold(v) (bold(y)) , quad bold(y)_0 = bx_0 $ The solution $t arrow.r bold(y) (t)$ describes
how a particle moves, carried by the fluid, also called #emph[streamline];.

As the domain $Omega$ is usually bounded, we cannot have fluid leaving the
domain. This means the fluid velocity must be zero in the normal direction of
the domain boundary. Hence
$ bold(v (x) dot.op n (x)) = 0 , quad forall bx in partial Omega $

#strong[Fourierâ€™s law in a moving fluid]
$ bold(j (x)) = - kappa grad u (bx) + bold(v (x)) rho u (bx) $
with $kappa$ the heat conductivity and $rho$ the volumetric heat capacity. We
already know the first part, called diffusive heat flux, from the heat equation.
The second part is called convective heat flux. With this new flux, the standard
PDE becomes
#neq(
  $ - div (kappa grad u) + div (rho bold(v (x)) u) = f quad upright("in ") Omega $,
) <eq:convection-diffusion-strong>
#strong[Incompressible Fluids]

A fluid is called incompressible if its associated flow map (evaluation
operator) $Phi^t$ is volume preserving. This is the case iff.
#align(center)[
  #subtle-box(width: 50%)[
    $ upright("div ") bold(v) equiv 0 quad upright("in ") Omega $
  ]
]
Hence the fluid is incompressible if its flow velocity is divergence-free.

// #theorem(number: "10.1.3.7", "Differentiation formula for determinants")[
//   Let $bold(S)$ be a smooth matrix-valued function. If $bold(S)$ is
//   regular then
//   $ frac(dif, dif t) upright("det") bold(S) (t) = upright("det") (bold(S) (t)) upright("tr") (frac(dif bold(S), dif t) (t) bold(S)^(- 1) (t)) $
//   with det the determinant and tr the trace of a matrix.
// ]

In case of incompressibility, equation @eq:convection-diffusion-strong can be
simplified using the general product rule @thm:general-product-rule and
$upright("div ") bold(v) = 0$
$ - div (kappa grad u) + bold(v (x)) dot.op grad rho u = f quad upright("in ") Omega $
We can also look at the time-dependent heat flow, which is similar to the heat
equation @eq:heat-local
#neq(
  $ frac(partial, partial t) med (rho u) - div (kappa grad u) + div (rho med bold(v) (bx ,t) med bu) = f quad upright("in ") Omega $,
)<eq:time-dependent-heat>
We will see later on how to solve this.

== Stationary Convection-Diffusion Problems
<sub:stationary-convection-diffusion>

Here we will focus on the convection diffusion equation
@eq:convection-diffusion-strong with constant $kappa$, $rho$, incompressible
flow
$bold(v)$ and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. Hence
$ - kappa Delta u + rho bold(v (x)) dot.op grad u = f quad upright("in ") Omega , #h(2em) u = 0 quad upright("on ") partial Omega $
Non-dimensionalizing the problem results in
#neq(
  $ - eps Delta u + bold(v (x)) dot.op grad u = f quad upright("in ") Omega , #h(2em) u = 0 quad upright("on ") partial Omega $,
) <eq:convection-diffusion-basic-strong>
with $norm(bold(v))_(L^oo (Omega)) = 1$. This results in the following
variational form
#neq(
  $ eps integral_Omega grad u dot.op grad w dif bx + integral_Omega (bold(v) dot.op grad u) w dif bx = integral_Omega f (bx) w dif x $,
) <eq:convection-diffusion-weak>
with the left-hand side the bilinear form $a (u , w)$. However, $a$ is not
symmetric. This also means that it does not induce an energy norm. However, it
is still positive definite (see lecture document).

=== Singular perturbation

A boundary value problem depending on a parameter $eps$ is called singularly
perturbed, if the limit problem for $eps arrow.r eps_0$ is not compatible with
the boundary conditions.

For $eps = 0$, the above PDE is singular perturbed. It cannot satisfy Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the _outflow_ part of the boundary.
// TODO: give a clear example
$ Gamma_(upright("out")) &= bx in partial Omega : bold(v (x)) dot.op bold(n (x)) > 0 \
Gamma_(upright("in"))  &= bx in partial Omega : bold(v (x)) dot.op bold(n (x)) < 0 $

=== Upwinding

When we solve Convection-Diffusion for $eps approx 0$ with the Galerkin method, we get
large (non-physical) oscillations in the solution. This is due to the fact that
the Galerkin matrix becomes close to singular. 
So our goal is to get a robust method that can
solve @eq:convection-diffusion-weak for any $eps >= 0$.

Consider again Eq. @eq:convection-diffusion-weak but in $d = 1$ and with zero
boundary conditions
$ eps integral_0^1 frac(partial u, partial x) frac(partial w, partial x) dif x + integral_0^1 frac(partial u, partial x) w dif x = integral_0^1 f (x) w dif x $
To calculate the Galerkin matrix for an equidistant mesh with $M$ cells, we use
the global composite trapezoidal rule for the convective term
$ integral_0^1 psi (x) dif x approx h sum_(j = 0)^M psi (j h) $
Hence the convective term of the bilinear form will be approximated by
$ integral_0^1 frac(partial u_h, partial x) med w_h dif x approx h sum_(j = 1)^(M - 1) colMath(frac(partial u_h, partial x) (j h), accentcolor) med w_h (j h) $
But $frac(partial u_h, partial x) (j h)$ is not defined: $u_h in cal(S)_(1 , 0)^0$ is
piecewise continuous, so its derivative has jumps at the nodes. However,
convection transports the information in the direction of $bold(v)$ ($= 1$
in our case). So we use the value of $frac(partial u_h, partial x)$ from "upwind",
i.e., in direction $-bold(v)$, which here is the value in the previous cell:
$ frac(partial u_h, partial x) (j h) = lim_(delta arrow.r 0) frac(partial u_h, partial x) (j h - delta bold(v)) = eval(frac(partial u_h, partial x)) _openint(x_(j - 1), x_j) $
And generalized in more dimensions
$ bold(v (p)) dot.op grad u_h (bold(p)) = lim_(delta arrow.r 0) bold(v (p)) dot.op grad u_h (bold(p) - delta bold(v (p))) $

#counter(heading).update((10, 2, 2, 1))
==== Streamline Diffusion

A different appproach to fix the problem of $eps arrow.r 0$ is to add artificial diffusion.
In 1D, this can be done by replacing $eps arrow.l eps + c (h)$ with $c (h) > 0$. 

For $d>1$, this is generalized to adding an $h$-dependent multiple of $Delta u$. With this artificial diffusion, we get
a different solution: there is "smearing in the internal layers", sharp jumps are smoothed out.

The remedy for this problem is to add diffusion only in the direction of streamlines. This results in the method of #emph[Anisotropic diffusion]:

On cell $K$, replace
$eps arrow.l eps bold(I) + delta_K bold(v)_K bold(v)_K^top$. Here, $bold(v)_K$ is
the local velocity, obtained by averaging over the vertices, and
$delta_K > 0$ some controlling parameter.

$ integral_Omega (eps bold(I) + delta_K bold(v)_K bold(v)_K^top) grad u dot.op grad w dif bx + integral_Omega (bold(v) dot.op grad u) w dif bx = integral_Omega f (bx) w dif bx $
However this affects the solution $u$, such that it will not be the same as the
one from Eq. @eq:convection-diffusion-weak. To get rid of this inconsistency,
the anisotropic diffusion can be introduced via a residual term

$ integral_Omega eps grad u dot.op grad w dif bx + integral_Omega (bold(v) dot.op grad u) w dif bx\
+ sum_(K in cal(M)) delta_K integral_K (- eps Delta u + bold(v) dot.op grad u - f) (bold(v) dot.op grad w) = integral_Omega f (bx) w dif bx $
The added term will be zero for the exact solution and we still have a diffusion term. The control parameter is usually chosen
according to
$ delta_K = cases(
  delim: "{", eps^(- 1) h_K^2 & quad upright("if ") norm(bold(v))_(K , oo) h_K lt.eq 2 eps, h_K & quad upright("if ") norm(bold(v))_(K , oo) h_K > 2 eps,

) $
With this, the $Order(h_(cal(M))^2)$ convergence of
$norm(u-u_h)_(L^2 (Omega))$ for $h$-refinement is preserved, while upwind
quadrature only achieves $Order(h_(cal(M)))$ convergence.

#pagebreak(weak: true)
== Discretization of Time-Dependent Convection-Diffusion IBVPs
<sub:discrete-time-dependent-convection-diffusion>

Now we will take a look at how time-dependent (also called _transient_)
convection-diffusion can be modeled. Assuming the incompressibility condition
and non-dimensionalizing, @eq:time-dependent-heat becomes
#neq(
  $ frac(partial u, partial t) - eps Delta u + bold(v)(bx, t) dot.op grad u = f quad upright("in ") Omega $,
) <eq:transient_conv_diff>
If we solve this with the method of lines (@sub:method-of-lines) without upwind
quadrature, oscillations occur. But with upwinding, we get damping, which is
also wrong. Therefore, we need a different method. Again, we need to take care
of the limit $eps arrow.r 0$. So let's first look at the pure transport problem
($eps = 0$):
$ frac(partial u, partial t) + bold(v)(bx, t) dot.op grad u = f quad upright("in ") Omega $

Its solution is given by the #emph[Method of Characteristics]
#neq(
  $ u (bx , t) = cases(
    delim: "{", u_0 (bold(x_0)) + integral_0^t f (bold(y) (s) , s) dif s & upright("if ") bold(y) (s) in Omega quad &forall 0 < s < t, g (bold(y) (s_0) , s_0) + integral_(s_0)^t f (bold(y) (s) , s) dif s quad& upright("if ") bold(y) (s_0) in partial Omega and bold(y) (s) in Omega quad &forall s_0 < s < t,

  ) $,
) <eq:moc>

where $bold(y) (t)$ is defined as the solution of
$dot(bold(y)) (t) = bold(v \( y) (t) , t \)$ and describes a streamline.

We have the initial condition $u_0$ on $Omega$ and the Dirichlet boundary
condition $g$ on the inflow boundary (see @eq:heat-bc-ic for definitions). This
method works as follows: We follow a streamline backwards in time starting at $bx$.

Then, the solution consists of two parts: The inital value of $u$ at $t=0$ and
the integral of the source function $f$ from 0 to $t$ along the streamline. This
is described by the first case for a streamline that stays inside the domain.
The second case is for a streamline that leaves the domain. Here, $s_0$ is the
time at which the streamline intersects the boundary, and we use the boundary
value $g$ as the initial value at time $s_0$.

#strong[Splitting Methods]

Given a general ODE whose right-hand side is the sum of two functions
$ dot(bold(y)) = bold(g) (t , bold(y)) + bold(r) (t , bold(y)) $ The Strang
Splitting single step method provides a method to solve this.

#mybox(
  "Strang Splitting",

  $bold(y)^((j))$ according to

  and $t_(j + 1) = t_j + tau$

  If the IVP in each sub-step is solved exactly or with a 2nd-order time stepping
  method, the Strang splitting method is of second order.

We can now apply this to Eq. @eq:transient_conv_diff.
$ frac(partial, partial t) &u             &= quad                & eps Delta u       & quad f - bold(v) & dot.op grad u\
                         &arrow.t.b     & quad                 & med med arrow.t.b & quad             & med med arrow.t.b\
                         & dot(bold(y)) &= quad bold(  &g (y)) &                   &bold(r(y)) $ This
amounts to once solving pure diffusion
$ frac(partial t, partial z) - eps Delta z = 0 $ and once pure transport
$ frac(partial t, partial w) + bold(v) dot.op grad u = f $ To solve the pure
transport problem, we have seen the method of characteristics @eq:moc. However,
it requires integration along streamlines. We can approximate these integrals by imagining particles being carried by the velocity field and "following" them along their pathlines. This *particle method*
works as follows:

+ Pick suitable interpolation nodes $bold(p)_i$, the initial particle positions.

+ Solve initial value problems
  $ bold(dot(y)) (t) = bold(y)(bold(v)(t), t) quad , quad bold(y) (0) = bold(p)_i $
  with suitable single step methods.

+ Reconstruct the approximation. E.g., with the composite midpoint rule,
  $ u_h^((j)) (bold(p)_i^((j))) = u_0 (bold(p)_i) + tau sum_(l = 1)^(j - 1) f (1 / 2 (bold(p)_i^l + bold(p)_i^(l - 1)) , 1 / 2 (t_l + t_(l - 1))) $

Basically, we have an interpolation problem with nodes that change over time. At
each step, we need to add particles at the inflow boundary and remove ones that
leave the domain. This means we need to re-mesh in each step, i.e., create a new
triangular mesh with the advected nodes/particles.

=== Semi-Lagrangian Method
<sub:semi-lagrangian>

#tip-box(
  "",
)[
  Check out this #link("https://youtu.be/kvBRFxRIJuY", "video") for an
  intuitive explanation of the method in 1D.
]

The Semi-Lagrangian method, contrary to the particle method, uses a _fixed_ mesh.
#definition(
  number: "10.3.4.2", "Material derivative", ..unimportant,
)[
  Given a velocity field $bold(v)$, the material derivative of a function
  $f$ is given by
  $ frac(D u, D bold(v)) (bx , t_0) = lim_(tau arrow.r 0) frac(u (bx , t_0) - u (Phi^(t_0 , t_0 - tau) bx , t_0 - tau), tau) $
]

By the chain rule we find
$ frac(D u, D bold(v)) (bx , t) = grad u (bx , t) dot.op bold(v \( x) , t \) + frac(partial, partial t) u(bx , t) $

Hence the transient convection-diffusion equation @eq:transient_conv_diff can be
rewritten as
$ frac(D u, D bold(v)) - eps Delta u = f quad upright(" in ") Omega $
We will now approximate the material derivative by a backwards difference. It is
easy to interpret that expression: the total change of $u$ in a timestep for a
particle is the difference of the current $u^((j))$ at the particle's current
position $bx$ minus the value of the previous function $u^((j - 1))$ at the
particle's old position $Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx$. We get a semi-discretization
$ frac(u^((j)) (bx) - u^((j - 1)) (Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx), tau) - eps Delta u^((j)) = f (bx , t_j) quad upright(" in ") Omega $
with additional initial conditions for $t = t_j$. We can apply the standard
Galerkin method to this semi-discretization.
$ integral_Omega frac(u^((j)) (bx) - u^((j - 1)) (Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx), tau) w(bx) dif bx + eps integral_Omega grad u^((j)) dot.op grad w dif bx = integral_Omega f (bx , t_j) w(bx) dif bx $
Unfortunately this cannot be implemented as is because the function
$u^((j - 1)) (Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx)$ is not a finite element function on $cal(M)$.

To get around this, we do two things: Replace $Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx$ by $bx - tau bold(v)(bx, t_j)$ (an
explicit Euler step) and replace $u^((j - 1)) (Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx)$ by its
linear interpolant $I_1 (u^((j - 1)) (Phi^(t_j , t_j - tau) bx))$.
$ integral_Omega frac(
  u^((j)) (bx) - I_1 lr({u^((j - 1)) (bold(s) - tau bold(v)(bold(s) , t_j))}, size: #110%) (bx), tau,

) w(bx) dif bx + eps integral_Omega grad u^((j)) dot.op grad w dif bx = integral_Omega f (bx , t_j) w(bx) dif bx $
Here, $bold(s)$ is the variable on which the interpolation operator $I_1$ acts
(in the lecture notes, this variable is written as a dot "$med dot.op med$").
The above equation still looks quite complicated, but can be implemented.
